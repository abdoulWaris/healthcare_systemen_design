# MedX healthcare system design
### üè• Scalable, Reliable, and Secure Healthcare System Design
## 1. System Overview

A healthcare platform that supports:

- User Management Service

- Teleconsultation Scheduling Service

- Consultation Service

- Patient Records Management Service

- Prescription Management Service

- Pharmacy Interface Service

- Notification Service

- Billing and Payment Service

 ### ‚úÖ Key Design Principles
 ## üìà Scalability

Microservices architecture: Each service can be independently scaled (e.g., EHR service under high load due to frequent doctor queries).

- Auto-scaling: Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU/memory or queue depth.

- Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple app instances (AWS ALB/NLB or NGINX).

- Database sharding: Split patient data across shards to reduce DB load.

- Caching: Use Redis for frequent reads like appointment slots, user sessions.
  
 ## üîí Security

- Authentication & Authorization:

  - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for secure user logins.

  - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for different user roles (doctor, admin, patient).

- Data Encryption:

  - At rest: Encrypt DBs using AES-256.

  - In transit: TLS 1.3 for all data transfers.

- Audit Logs:

  - Immutable logs of access to patient records.

- Compliance:

  - Ensure HIPAA, GDPR, or local regulations are met.

- Secrets Management:

  - Store credentials in secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager).

### üîÅ Reliability

- **Redundancy**
  - Deploy across multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**.
  - Use **database replication** (primary + replicas) to ensure high availability and data durability.

- **Message Queues**
  - Use **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous processing (e.g., sending lab results, appointment reminders).

- **Graceful Degradation**
  - Provide fallback behavior.  
    _Example: If the Telemedicine service fails, display an appropriate message or enable rescheduling._

- **Health Checks**
  - Implement **Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes** to automatically detect and recover from failures.

- **Disaster Recovery**
  - Perform **automated database backups**.
  - Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like **Terraform** for fast infrastructure recovery.

### üß™ Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Real-time monitoring (e.g., CPU, memory usage, request latency).
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging across microservices.
- **Sentry / Datadog**: Error tracking and performance monitoring.
- **Alerting**: Integrate with **PagerDuty** or **Opsgenie** for critical incident alerts and on-call rotation.
